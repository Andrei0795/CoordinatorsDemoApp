# CoordinatorsDemoApp
A repository with a functional iOS app showcasing the use of Coordinators and MVVM in swift

During the previous years, I have had the opportunity to better understand MVVM and MVVM-C. This is an app that showcases a basic TabBar application and its various coordinators. It tries to emulate a login and the display of information in tabs + modals + pushed view controllers. 

Enjoy!
